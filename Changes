Revision history for Debug-Xray

0.03    12/17/2011  
        Streamlined watch_vars to only take a reference to a scalar and figure out the variable name from that. (Need to implement on arrays and hashes.)
        More consistent naming. Routines with the word 'hook' in the name are changed to 'watch' to be more consistent with the watch variables routines.  

0.04    12/18/2011
        Fixed signal trapping so it could be turned off and on. It passes tests, but needs a better workout.

0.05    12/20/2011
        Got Xray.pm ready for CPAN. Put in POD and straightened things out a little.
